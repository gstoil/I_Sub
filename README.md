This class implements the string matching method proposed in the paper
 * Giorgos Stoilos, Giorgos Stamou, Stefanos Kolias. A String Metric For Ontology Alignment. In proceedings of the 4th International Semantic Web Conference, 2005 [Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11574620_45)
 
The method is particularly useful when intending to match strings representing different types (entities, concepts, classes) and properties from two different dictionaries/ontologies/taxonomies. For example, one medical taxonomy may have concept labelled "Venography of left upper limb" whereas another may have the same concept labelled "Left upper limb venogram".
