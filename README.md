This class implements an algorithm to compute a similarity score between two sentences, phrases, or strings. The method has been presented in the following paper:
 * Giorgos Stoilos, Giorgos Stamou, Stefanos Kolias. A String Metric For Ontology Alignment. In proceedings of the 4th International Semantic Web Conference, 2005 [Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11574620_45)
 
The method is particularly useful (and perhaps complementary to existing edit distance methods) when intending to match types (entities, concepts, classes) and properties defined in different dictionaries/ontologies/taxonomies, a problem commonly referred to as Ontology Alignment/Schema Matching. For example, one medical taxonomy may have concept labelled "Venography of left upper limb" whereas another may have the same concept labelled "Left upper limb venogram". Such cases are encountered very often in large dictionaries that include composite types like for example medical ontologies/taxonomies (SNOMED vs NCI vs ICD-10). Other examples could be a concept labelled "IndianRestaurant" and another labelled "Restaurant with Indian Cuisine".
